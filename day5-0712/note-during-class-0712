tomorrow : oop and -> data science, machine learning


Newton's laws of motion


F = ma

action/reaction


position (x, y)


velocity = change in position/ change in time

average
< velocity > = change in position / change in time


< average > = 

<jerk> = accel / time

now we are calcul these things


in earth -> pen drop
9.8 meters / 1sec

prebla


velo final - velo initial = <average> * time


how about original acent?? why sun up and down??? tomorrow?

there is no time???

time does not exist

always measure the velocity?


modern time ~~


pendulem : over and over -> time?


it is amazing where we living it's so simple


very simple rule -> very complicated things
