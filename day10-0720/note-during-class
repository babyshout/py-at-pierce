there is many package -> so need the __name__ == "__main__"

silicon based processor

what is machine learning?

what is the learning?

you saying russian -> i can repeat it but it is the learning?


logical deduction??

there was a stole -> really hot -> he touch -> burned
-> learn something

you take some logic -> ~~~~ bunch of knowleage

you could take some

two seperate thing -> something new ->
you can take knife -> ascent -> ~~~ hunting
maybe tree -> you can burn it -> tree and knife -> cut it and make house
put it back together -> make house???
create something new -> 

so computer can do this?
so we all know -> search term ~~~ -> that's really
this time strongest things computer can do

what generative 
predicting

predicting where it will fall

how do we program computer ~~~ how can they do that

how do we ask computer

netflix first starte DVD rental store with mail
ask time and on ~~~ DVD of movie
you have to predict which movie is most famous
we have to ~~ develop the algorithm
what podcast, store, music~~~

you can go buy previous history -> find out ~~ category ~~ ->
logical deduction

where is the other way -> genre? population what is popular
popular on netflix, continue watching for ~~, Trending NOW
prejectory
same idea but more strict -> how popularity change??
less people watch this then yesterday
this is all has like calculus -> if you learn calculus -> we can talk more deeper


male female, where are you living, how about your friend, how many old?
amazon know he is marry -> ~~~~~~ use this info
is doing something here -> past shoping~~, suggetions

instagram -> 


we have all of this ~~ -> REDFIN??
showing us the price~~ -> lakewood is a hot market

features~~ (functions?)

how to go about this -> let me show resources



standard deviations?

normal distributions
what we wanna do ~~ how spread data out

we have to square it

find average distance -> what is the average distance~~ -> once we know that -> we can minimize the differences
we can make predictions -> for instance -> price of the house -> then ~~~~ and we train the computer the differences mmake it minimal small as possible

I wish
let's see here

cost functions -> cost is diffrent ~~ -> why x here is prediction -> x is some of are features and house example -> we have size of the house
-> big house 
a is actuall price ~~ -> in general it is difference
now we are gonna do minimize the cost functions
how do you minimize the function

use the slope here -> 

Regression -> different line point -> single point

i means all of this feature

gradient tell you fastest way(stiffest)
to minimize the cost function

you can minimize this if you do this billions times


chatGPT 2point 2billion w and b -> in English


calculus, statistics, linear algebra
computations

gradient idea start from physics?
minimize the energy state???
